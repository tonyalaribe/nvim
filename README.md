## README

This repo holds my neovim configuration. It is designed to be cloned into the
config folder. ie ~/.config/nvim, as it depends on the lua files being available
in the runtime path.

Expected icon fonts for the parent terminal:
https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono

Preferably with the bold variant as normal and the extra bold varient as the
bold. As this gives me the contrast i'm used to.

For the parent terminal colorscheme, I use the one dark theme. In my case, one
dark for the kitty terminal.
